# Grass Launch

GrassLaunch is a light launcher for Minecraft Java Edition using Python. Currently, it only has "Cracked" accounts, but i'm working on adding minecraft auth.
You can enter the GrassLaunch website [here](https://julenra-dev.github.io/GrassLaunch/)

This was made using Python 3.10, but newer versions should work fine with GrassLaunch
